    "\n",
    "- Recursion is a technique for a  function to make one or more calls to itself. This quality can be used to form smaller instances of the exact same type of data structure from a bigger data structure or vise-versa. \n",
    "- Recursion actually occurs in the real world, such as fractal patterns seen in plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion shines in performing repetitive tasks where loop is not ideal. It can serve as a great tool for building out particular data structures.\n",
    "_______\n",
    "### Example: Factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lecture we will explain recursion through an example excercise of creating the factorial function.\n",
    "The factorial function is denoted with an exclamation point and is defined as the product of the integers from 1 to *n*. Formally, we can state this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n! = n·(n-1)·(n-2)... 3·2·1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, **if n = 0, then n! = 1**. This is important to take into account, because it will serve as our *base case*. "

    "Take this example:\n",
    "$$4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24. $$\n",
    "So how can we state this in a recursive manner? This is where the concept of **base case** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base case** is a key part of understanding recursion, especially when it comes to having to solve interview problems dealing with recursion. Let's rewrite the above equation of 4! so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4! = 4 · (3 · 2 · 1) = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4! = 4 · 3! = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning we can rewrite the formal recursion definition in terms of recursion like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n! = n·(n−1)!$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, **if n = 0, then n! = 1**. This means the **base case** occurs once n=0, the *recursive cases* are defined in the equation above. Whenever you are trying to develop a recursive solution it is very important to think about the base case, as your solution will need to return the base case once all the recursive cases have been worked through. Let's look at how we can create the factorial function in Python:\n",
